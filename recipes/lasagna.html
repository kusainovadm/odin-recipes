        <h2>Pasta Carbonara (for 2 servings)</h2>
        <p>Carbonara is a true Italian classic made with just a few ingredients but full of flavor. The creamy sauce is made without cream — just eggs, cheese, and pasta water, giving it a silky and rich texture. The key is controlling the heat so the eggs don't scramble.</p>
        <p>It takes under 20 minutes to prepare. Fry the bacon, boil the pasta, whisk the eggs with cheese, and quickly mix everything together in one pan. Serve immediately while it's hot and delicious. </p>
